# A Five on the Enneagram and Other Myths I Tell Myself

The tests are consistent, and conversation reinforces it.
I am a five.
There were nine possibilities, and right there smack dab _(actually dabs)_ in the middle I’ve found myself.

Conveniently, I gather information from my solitude.
Eliminating dependencies is a virtue, and relationships aren’t exempt.
A few good friends, loyal to the ends.
Of the earth, more information.
A wellspring.
A flood of decisions.

## EXPLAIN

I was drawn to poetry early. Somewhere the thread was lost, and I’m slowly retracing it. My prose is stale, if not utterly inefficient for transmitting an emotion. Not to mention the layered emotions that meet between hope and indifference.

But as I begin to write again, I unqualifiably “feel alive” and “like myself” for the first time in a long time. Joy in the valley.

As much as I feign independence, I value connections deeply. I share to solicit emails (messages, not addresses), and maybe we’ll become friends.

## ABOUT

_A Five on the Enneagram and Other Myths I Tell Myself_ is a collection of poetry I wrote between October and November 2019.
It is mostly a stream of consciousness I hammered into Notes.app on iOS while I sat in my home office, church, bed, etc.
