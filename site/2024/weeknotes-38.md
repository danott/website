# Weeknotes: 2024, Week 38

We've been cutting back our spending. This results in lots of home cooked meals. And activity focused on keeping a tidy kitchen to keep the meal prep flowing smoothly. It's been a nice change of pace.

It also reveals how often my weeknotes are about the restaurants I've enjoyed. I did make it to South of Wrigley once again to introduce a new friend to a new (to them) restaurant.

Sunday provided the highlights of the week. Mountain biking and smash burgers. I rode my friend's [Krampus](https://surlybikes.com/bikes/krampus). It made me dangerously overconfident on the trails and now I want one.
