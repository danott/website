# Weeknotes: 2024, Week 7

Something every night this week. Ballet and Taekwondo and Ash Wednesday and friend dinner and sabbath and date night in. A sick child and I stayed home from the Ash Wednesday service. We played Smash Bros instead. 

On Friday I toasted a prosciutto, cheese, and chili crisp mayo sandwich on a baguette. I was active every day with yoga and lifting and running and walking. 

[Tuk Tuk Snack Shop](https://www.tuktuksnackshop.com) has been on my list to try. The Webster (a bougie chicken sandwich) delivered. 

I wonder if there's a correlation between a good week and the quality of the sandwiches I consumed? Causation, even?

I bought a [bright orange YETI Rambler](https://amzn.to/3US8ImS) because my existing water receptacle doesn't fit in my car's cup holders. 35oz consumed four times today. 

Another [Magic Puzzle Company puzzle](https://amzn.to/3US8ImS) is near completion. I won't finish it right now because it's Emily's turn to get out of town for a few days. 

I gave the kids donuts for breakfast and Mountain Dew with dinner. Letting my children live my twelve year old dreams. 

Mario vs Donkey Kong is a good puzzle game. Not as good as Captain Toad Treasure Tracker. But worthy of the Mario theming. 

Haven't made it to the climbing gym this month. I fear it's falling out of favor in light of running and weight lifting being more immediately available. That and there's no sauna or steam shower at my climbing gym.
