# How to bulk text in 2010

I am attempting to organize 15+ years of notes into [Bear](https://bear.app). While reviewing untagged notes I came across this gem. I believe this was around September 2010.

I was researching options for bulk texting. Twilio was the up-and-comer that I wanted to use, but wasn't quite available in the timeframe I needed. If I remember correctly we went with OptIt. 

Some of these links are broken. Others have pivoted or niched down. OptIt's website looks unchanged. Twilio is what I would use today.

But before that, I'd question the effectiveness of a bulk texting campaign. It was novel at the time. But now my default reply to these requests is  `STOP`.
