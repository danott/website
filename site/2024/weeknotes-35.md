# Weeknotes: 2024, Week 35

Another week in Lexington.

We built a playset in our back yard. The raw materials arrived on Monday afternoon and the structure was erected by Monday evening. This is the kind of turnaround time you want with large packages flowing into your home.

Emily got out of town for an evening. Solo parenting was uneventful in the best kind of ways.

Cirque du Soleil came to town. We beat the heatwave by going to the circus. Ovo was the traveling show. It was a blast for all involved.

We ate mexican food at a restaurant that brings out entire tortillas that you break into chips yourself. It’s a good reality check. “Do you want chips & salsa?” is the question. “Do you want to eat 8 entire tortillas before your meal?” is the quantification. Really makes you think. And fills you up.

A close friend was ordained to the priesthood in the Anglican Church. It was a big day for him, and it was a treat to join in celebration. Kids sat quietly in church for two hours which is a testament that miracles still happen.
