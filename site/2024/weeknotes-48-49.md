# Weeknotes: 2024, Weeks 48â€“49

- Hosted Thanksgiving. A mayo-rubbed turkey on the smoker was delicious. The honey-baked ham was more delicious, still
- Celebrated Hanksgiving with a viewing of That Thing You Do
- H joined the climbing team at the local gym, so I've started climbing again
- Got sick, then sicker, then sicker, but I'm finally on the upswing
- Ran a below-freezing 5K with H, her first ever!
- Took S to see Moana 2 on the big screen with the largest popcorn she'd ever seen
- Gave E access to Fortnite and we won our first two Duo Battle Royale matches
- Finally watched Only Murders in the Building (season one) and it was good
- Migrated a bunch of my notes out of Bear into plain text files
- When sick, I watch 24. That Jack Bauer plays by his own rules
