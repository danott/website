# Weeknotes: 2024, Week 12

Another week in the books. Another energy level of bullet points.

- First mow of the year. The grass is greener.
- Back to finishing my workday at the time I desire to finish.
- Ran a neighborhood 10k. Terminated at the gym where I could soak in the sauna.
- Attended a bootcamp at the gym and got sore in places that haven’t been sore in a long time
- Gave H a Nintendo Switch and Princess Peach Showtime. It’s a hit!
- Found time to write, and the ideas start flowing
- Created an iOS automation that automatically closes Instagram when I launch it after 10pm. Go to bed!
- Decided to be all about that March Madness for the first year ever. Ambient basketball noise is calming. My bracket that had UK going all the way was busted on the first evening. Still fun.
- I no longer finish the whole bowl when I order chipotle. My stomach is shrinking in my old age.
- Finished watching season three of The Morning Show. It’s fine.
- Week two of my new responsibilities at work went well. Feeling the load.
- Italian beef at [South of Wrigley](https://www.southofwrigley.com/) with Matt is always a treat for the meal and the conversation.
