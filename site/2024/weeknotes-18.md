# Weeknotes: 2024, Week 18

Week 17 was a blur of preparing for a week away from home. I remember bike rides, shooting hoops, eating donuts, uninstalling a 25 year old dishwasher, and installing its replacement. And a team broke ground on our patio renovation. Lots of dirt moving around. 

Week 18 was spent in California. Sundays were travel days. Monday thru Thursday were work days. Friday and Saturday were Disney days. 

We found 27 hidden Pizza Planet trucks. And rode a boatload of rides. Guardians of the Galaxy remains the favorite. Star Tours remains underrated. Experienced two above average Jungle Cruise captains. Experienced two predictably top notch corn dogs from the Little Red Wagon. Did not make it to the Corn Dog Castle this time.

The work trip was a success. The biggest event of the year that my team is responsible for. With my team being eight weeks old, Iâ€™m incredibly proud of the event we put together.

I pushed too hard in the weeks between Florida and California. The fixed time and fixed scope made it necessary, but the pace was unsustainable. Looking forward to re-establishing healthy rhythms that can sustain a career. 

The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes became available for rent. Watching that has kicked off a revisiting of all the Hunger Games films. 

Life is good back in the Bluegrass.
