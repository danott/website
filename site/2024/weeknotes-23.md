# Weeknotes: 2024, Week 23

Solo fathering through the weekend. We had a string of simple days where we played outside and wrapped the day up with a movie. Emily returned from her trip a day late because airlines are going to delay what airlines are going to delay. This made for a severely abbreviated work week between planned time off and reactionary time off.

Went to Asheville for the weekend. Big cabin with a big group. Quiet on the porch and conversation in the hot tub were some of the highlights.

Took a little stroll on the Blue Ridge Parkway before heading back north to Lexington by way of Smokey Mountain National Park. Made the worst traveling error of my life by driving through McDonaldâ€™s, only to find that the supercharger was in the parking lot of a Five Guys. Should have scrolled further in on the map before committing to fast food instead of slightly higher quality fast food.
