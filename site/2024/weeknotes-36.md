# Weeknotes: 2024, Week 36

Labor day came and went without much work. A small group of friends celebrated with a salute to processed meat.

I got on a plane Tuesday Morning to head to the city that never sleeps, the big apple, the home of pizza rat: New York City.

[LeadDev New York](https://leaddev.com/events) was the catalyst for the trip. I met up with 11 workplace proximity associates to soak up everything we can to grow as engineering leaders. This was my second year in a row attending the conference, and I continue to be impressed with the British organization.

Outside of the conference hours, time in New York City was excellent. We walked [The High Line](https://www.thehighline.org/visit/) two evenings in a row. It's much different in late summer than early spring.

We ventured to [Milk Bar](https://milkbarstore.com/?view=sl-A1335AD7) two evenings in a row. I got the crunchy cereal milkshake the first evening. I had to settle for soft serve the second evening because Milk Bar was, ironically, out of milk. Talk about branding problems.

Dinners took place at [Roberta's](https://www.robertaspizza.com), [Wayla](https://www.waylanyc.com), and [Hudson Clearwater](http://www.hudsonclearwater.com). Each meal more impressive than the last.

A bagel with cream cheese and fish is a must. This time we went to [Russ & Daughter's](https://www.russanddaughters.com). Very good.

DMA and I ran about four miles on the Hudson River Greenway. Running with a buddy is very different. We stopped, looked around for a while, and I still outpaced myself compared to running alone. But also, just the volume of people running in NYC changes the feels. It feels like the energy of a race day, which also helped me pick up the pace.

We wound up at the 9/11 Memorial, which was corded off in preparations for a cemony on 9/11/2024. We grieved being able to not get close with a [Simpl](https://maps.apple.com/?address=59%20Nassau%20St,%20New%20York,%20NY%20%2010038,%20United%20States&auid=9794406090244059572&ll=40.709339,-74.008882&lsp=9902&q=Simpl%20Coffee) coffee.

Navigating the subway felt simple. Zero horrifying stories this time around.

I didn't return to Lexington. Instead, I flew back to Cincinnati. Emily and I got a night away in the queen city. We watched Beetlejuice and ate snacks without any small humans asking us to do stuff for them. It was everything I want in a getaway. 

Brunch at Maplewood on Saturday preceded a day of shopping. Sierra is my new favorite store. It's like browsing TJ Maxx but with stuff I actually want. 

We ventured into Over the Rhine to grab dinner at [Teak](https://www.teakotr.com) before seeing Mamma Mia at the Aronoff. They did a good job. Abba Gold is now back on heavy rotation.

I got back home to see my kiddos on Sunday. It's good to be welcomed back.
