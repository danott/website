# Weeknotes: 2024, Week 34

This week was completely full with good things that I want to remember.

Monday—the oldest and youngest joined me on a journey to Meijer, Target, Walmart, and back to Target in the search for 24” tubes and tires. We were searching for road tires, but we ended up going for the brick-and-mortar availability of mountain bike tires.

Tuesday—I went running in the morning, concluding at the sauna. After a solid day of work I transitioned from working with my brain to working with my hands by installing the new tubes and tires from Monday night's excursion. The kids helped.

Wednesday—kept up the habit of walking and running in the morning. I cooked an abundance of bratwurst and smashed potatoes on the flat top. The kids rode their bikes all around the yard with a new understanding of mountain bike tires allowing for bikes to go off pavement. Finished a chapter book with the girls and went to the sauna for an evening seat. 

Thursday—took a break from running, and focused all that time on walking four miles in the morning. We shut down the house for two nights in Cincinnati. The motivation for the journey north was seeing Rancid, Smashing Pumpkins, and Green Day in concert. I've never been to an arena show. It delivered in the best way. I was living my middle school dreams.

Friday—I was able to sleep in. Back to running, which was difficult when starting midday. I concluded my 4 mile run at United Dairy Farmers. I drank a milkshake and walked the distance back to my parent's house.

Saturday—another day of sleeping in, with a slow morning before heading back to Lexington. We watched a movie as a family.

Sunday—6am wake up. On the weekend. A consistent wake-up time regardless of the day is an ideal I aspire to, so this was a win. I plotted a run for 8 miles, but ended up running 10. This is the longest distance I have ever continually run, and I was happy about it. While running I considered what word I would start Wordle with, and I literally got Wordle on the first guess. I went to the sauna before church. I worked in the yard for 5 hours after church. I went to bed on time ready for the next week.
