# Badlands

The hotel in Sioux Falls provided a just fine night of sleep from what I remember. We continued deeper into South Dakota, with more sightseeing than the previous day. 

We made some insignificant stops to charge. Al's Oasis had a grocery where we found Tootsie Pops, cheese, crackers, apples, and Cheetos. Tailgating with hand foods became a routine posture. 

We made our way to the Minuteman Missile National Historic Site. Lots of Cold War history to take in. More than we were able. We touched a piece of the Berlin Wall. I refilled our water bottles. The reference of guaranteed 30 minute delivery in the style of Domino's Pizza made me laugh and want a Domino's Pizza. The kids were drawn to the old timey TV. 

Just down the road is Badlands. We leisurely hiked the Saddle Pass Trail. The payoff at the top was worth the journey. Seeing our tiny car down in the parking lot provided a big sense of accomplishment for our tiny humans on the top of the world.

It's hard to describe the beauty of the Badlands. So I won't. Go see them. 

The final leg of our Sunday drive aimed toward Wall, SD. We made a big deal of pointing out all the billboards for Wall Drug as we  passed them. Hundreds of miles of advertisement provided a glacial countdown to the home of the Jackalope.

We arrived at dusk and Wall Drug was closed for the evening. We checked into the Hansen Inn, walked to a burger joint that was open, and made plans to go to Wall Drug in the morning.
