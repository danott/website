# Weeknotes: 2024, Week 50

The week was routine'ish. The normal after-school activities took place. We hosted a dinner on Wednesday night. I worked a routine schedule for a five-day week.

We headed out-of-town to a friend's house for the weekend. The kinds of friends where you pick up right where you left off. We got out of the house for a farmers market, but other than that it was uneventful in the best way. We smoked meat, sat around a fire pit, and watched movies on a projector.

Is it farmer's market, farmers' market, or farmers market? Maybe it can be either.

I have a short work week coming up, then I'm off for an extended break. My brain needs it, and I am ready.
