# Weeknotes: 2024, Week 22

Memorial Day on Monday and a Free Friday on Friday made for an expedited work week. My hiring efforts terminated in offering two candidates a position. Waiting the long weekend ahead means waiting to hear back.

Emily's birthday celebrations continued with a meal at [Favor](https://www.eatfavor.com). Then she got on an airplane to go on a girls' trip with some friends.

Solo dad weekend commenced. A bike ride to Chick-fil-a was our first excursion. Breakfast for dinner on the flattop grill was another success. Lots of swimming and tennis. A movie night every night is great too.

I had two back-to-back folks provide an unsolicited comment on my apparent exhaustion. Both are trusted people who I check in with semi-regularly. I need to pay attention to that signal.
