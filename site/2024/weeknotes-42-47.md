# Weeknotes: 2024, Weeks 42â€“47

Life moves pretty fast. Six weeks out of 4000 in an average lifespan is 0.15% of my time. What stood out?

- Received a clean bill of health from my doctor. All the running and sauna'ing is creating a measurable difference in my metabolic health according to labs.
- I've kept up with the sauna'ing, but not so much with the running. Gotta bring back the consistency.
- Received a really bad haircut. Buzzed my own head to cope instead of confronting the hairdresser.
- Spent a week in California for work. Flight delays had me arriving late. Early mornings were just fine with me waking up before my alarm all days. Lots of face time to keep the remote work trust batteries topped up.
- Trick or treating in the pouring rain didn't stop my children. Keeping up the tradition of roaming the neighborhood with a crew of parents is a highlight of the fall.
- Solo parented for a weekend while Emily went away. Lots of movies, Halloween candy, and popcorn.
- I got away for my own weekend with some dudes. I disconnected from technology for the most part, which was a welcome change.
- I started migrating my personal notes from [Bear](https://bear.app) to [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer). I just cannot get past the ever-present desire to live in a world with flat files and folders. The authoring tools change, but the data remains readable with `cat`.
- I deployed my own Rails app to my own server using [kamal](https://kamal-deploy.org). I'm very optimistic about the ease-of-use for getting small hobby experiments out into the world.
- We spent a long weekend at the Red River Gorge with some friends and no children. The kids ate lots of sugar and watched lots of screens with their grandparents. 
- I read some books and bought some more books. I want to setup a bookshelf page on this website at some point.
