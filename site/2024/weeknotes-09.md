# Weeknotes: 2024, Week 9

Another beautiful week.

## Running

I took a break from running this week. I decided to listen to the early warning system my knee was activating. Foam rolling, sauna sitting, and regular stretching have me feeling ready to get out there.

## Climbing

The first climb of the month on the last day of the month. I decided to freeze my membership again. The climbing journey of the last two and a half years has been fun. I'm finding myself more drawn to lifting, running, yoga, and sitting in the sauna.

## Lifting

Made it the desired three times this week. I've been working the [Stronglifts 5x5](https://stronglifts.com/stronglifts-5x5/) regimen. My current working weights:

- Squat: 155 pounds
- Bench press: 105 pounds
- Barbell row: 125 pounds
- Overhead press: 75 pounds
- Deadlift: 145 pounds

There's room to push it. But I'm not inclined to overdo it. I'm building sustainable fitness habits.

## Highlights

Small memories that delight as I reflect on the week.

- We finished the final season of The Crown on Netflix. What a journey. Long live the queen.
- Tacos on Tuesday. Stumbling into a Taco Tuesday deal with friends.
- Two months of no alcohol. Not missing it!
- Taking a hot bath and watching Curb Your Enthusiasm.
- Taking in a University of Kentucky basketball game at Rupp with my friend and son.
- First week of taking notes with Bear has been an easy transition. The organizational options of the tagging semantics are emerging.
- Throwing frisbee in the backyard with E. Perfect throws and diving catches. Sunset signaling our need to eat.
- Conduct Together with all the kids.
- The southwest salad from Chick-fil-a with a heaping dollop of homemade chili crisp.
- Hibachi and Marikka's for a friend's birthday.
- *D2: The Mighty Ducks* movie night.
- Friends sending good music recommendations.
- Incense in the office.
