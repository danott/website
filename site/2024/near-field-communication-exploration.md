# Near-field communication exploration

A random Threads post has me interested in [NFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication) for cueing automation and sharing information. The a rabbit hole pursuer in my brain wants to understand the low level protocol of data exchange and passive power sharing. A desire to understand what the iPhone will respond to without application specific programming, and how that will inevitably vary from a plurality of Android devices. I want to push the limits of the protocol before I’ve even played within the beginner’s boundaries. 

Research so far points towards two necessary purchases to begin playing. 

1. [NFC Tools for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1252962749)
2. [Blank NTAG215 coins](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0CHVWTRGC?tag=url-percent-20)

I’m picking up this combination of software and hardware to see what can be done.
