# Weeknotes 2024: Weeks 28–33

I’m processing too much information and too many experiences to retain it all. Time to slow down.
## Week 28

I don’t even remember, honestly.

## Week 29

- Got back into running with two workouts. It’s too hot.
- Got off of Zoom and into walking and talking over phone calls. This is the way.
- Made space for daddy/daugher date with the youngest to Panera bread, the playground, and Coldstone.
- Making smashburgers for a friend. And the art of just sitting and talking.
- Mirror Twin Pizza on a Thursday night.
- Prioritizing sleep vs prioritizing an earlier work day. 8 hours of sleep and working later into the afternoon won.
- Made it to San Diego amidst the biggest tech outrage of our time. Only 6 hours late.

## Week 30

- Working in California. Lots of long days and walking meetings.
- Two days in a row of walking 25,000+ steps and 11+ miles.
- Crowdstrike delays complicated Emily’s return trip, but she made it home safe.
- Coming home on Friday with no delays. Picked up Asian Wind. 
- George retired from Asian Wind, and with him went George’s Sauce. He did not pass on the recipe.

## Week 31

- Rolled out big changes at work. 

## Week 32

- Living into the big changes at work. 
- Ran the Midsummer Night’s Run 5K on a perfect summer night. I set a personal record with an 11:10/mile pace.

## Week 33

- The kids returned to school. The structure is welcome. Morning walks have been absolutely perfect.
- Trying on subtle changes in church. 
- Impromptu hangout with friends was a perfect Saturday evening.
- I unironically wore my cowboy hat to a friend’s 40th birthday party at a speakeasy and it was nice.
