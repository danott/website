# Weeknotes: 2024, Week 20

Riding bikes to play tennis is a new pastime. Feels great to move.

Got back into a running groove. Not as many miles as previous efforts. But more days on the road.

Some sleepless nights reaked havoc on my body. 4am was the peak awake.

The structure of the Anglican church was less comforting, but ultimately helped me identify some things in myself that are hurting. So on the longer scale, more comforting and deeper connection resulted.
