# Introducing Complexity

Introducing complexity is the easy way out. More checkboxes. More buttons. More explanatory text. More customization, at the root of the matter.

Cutting things away is the hard work of design. Making hard, but necessary decisions. Then believing and explaining them so boldly that it provides detox for those addicted to customization.

Will you sign every customer? Certainly not. But those you win over will share your values. They'll be solving real problems, free from the anxiety brought on by endless tinkeringâ€”the fear of missing out on perfected customization. And you'll have a much simpler surface area to maintain.

Everybody wins.
