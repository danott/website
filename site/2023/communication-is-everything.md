# Communication is everything

Communication is everything. Silence says more than words. Prolonged silence, even more-so. But it might not be what you want! Silence gets interpreted. Worst case scenarios win out. Opinions are formed. Reinforced. And hard to undo.

Being a charitable listener is a grace. It requires effort. It assumes the best. But it does not assign the best when the worst comes true. It is patient. It assumes the best, and waits for the truth. The assumption does not become the truth. But it helps you wait.

Frequency is the key. Not quality. Nor quantity. Simply showing up, and practicing for a small bit.
