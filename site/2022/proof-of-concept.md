# Proof of concept

The real test starts now. Can I author a post from my mobile device in a few minutes of downtime? This first attempt is using GitHub's file browser to author a markdown file. 

My next idea for iteration is using GitHub issues for capturing drafts. Adding a custom label could act as the trigger for publishing. That would require actions. Maybe copy pasting from a local note is totally sufficient. Whatever the caseâ€”that sounds like a fun experiment for another day.
