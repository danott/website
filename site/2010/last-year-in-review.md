# 2009: Year in Review

It may be two months late, but I saved this idea as a draft in December to do a review of my life in 2009. A lot happened last year:

- Went to Ireland
- Quit my job
- Got a girlfriend
- Went to Ireland
- Girlfriend starts a new job
- I start a new job
- Girlfriend becomes Fiancé
- Went to Italy and France
- Fiancé gets put in a cast while planning wedding because the steps attacked her
- Got a new apartment
- Fiancé becomes Wifepart
- Wifepart moves into aforementioned new apartment
- Went to Jamaica
- Survived first set of holidays with in-laws
- Wifepart survived first set of holidays with in-laws

I highlighted travel, relationship, and work because those are the things that stick out in my mind. A lot more happened, but that’s what comes to memory when I try to recall it quickly.

I am a blessed man.

(There was no risk of death with our in-laws. It’s just a stereotype, duh.)
