# 20 Twenty

Twenty twelve was all the Mayans promised\
Predictions of the future are just guesses\
Best guesses, yes\
But just guesses

A news broadcast\
Corrective lenseless living\
Habanero takes\
With the fishes, swimming

Goodbye to good buys\
Save yourself for yes\
No to opportunities\
Fear strikes hearts into the maple trunks
