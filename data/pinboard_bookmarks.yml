  title: Cold-blooded software
  commentary: "> Maybe your CI isn’t working because one of the services you depend
    on got bought or ran out of money. You add a new dependency and find yourself
    needing to upgrade your compiler. Another package you depend on is deprecated,
    and doesn’t work with the latest version of the compiler.\r\n>\r\n> Some projects
    are different. You work alone, make some changes when you’re inspired, and then
    don’t touch it again for another year, or two, or three. You can’t run something
    like that as a warm-blooded project. There’s not enough activity to keep the temperature
    up.\r\n\r\nThis dichotomy of \"warm-blooded software\" and \"cold-blooded software\"
    is really helpful. It invokes feelings of \"choose the right tool for the job\",
    but on an entirely different horizon. Production applications with paying customers
    can carry the costs of being a warm-blooded project. A personal blog might be
    more suited to being a cold-blooded project."

  commentary: "The Henry Ford quote is so well known in product development that I
    don't need to to quote it here.\r\n\r\n> “faster” wasn’t the selling point of
    cars over horses. Speed wasn’t the problem. Spending huge amounts of money, time,
    and space on keeping horses alive and dealing with the literal horse shit was
    the problem.\r\n\r\nThose original problems are so far removed from modern day.
    It's not intuitive to imagine the problems I've never had to solve. It's intuitive
    to substitue my modern problem of speed over everything.\r\n\r\n> TL;DR: Henry
    Ford did not say “If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said
    faster horses”. He pretty much said the exact opposite.\r\n\r\nListen to people.
    Get their point of view. Discover their problems."

  title: Efficiency trades off against resiliency
  commentary: "> I mean a much more general notion of “ability to absorb or respond
    to change” – change of all sorts, including both bugs or failures, but also change
    in product needs, change in the market, change in the organization or team composition,
    whatever.\r\n\r\nThe true competitive advantage is being able to adapt to changing
    conditions.\r\n\r\n> A system with no slack is efficient as long it works, but
    brittle and will break down quickly in the presence of any changes to its usual
    operating modes.\r\n\r\n> When we accuse a system of being wasteful and inefficient,
    it’s worth pausing to ask what that “waste” may be buying. When we set out to
    optimize a system, pause to understand where the joints and flexibility in the
    current system are, and which ones are vital, and to do our best to preserve those.
    When we set metrics or goals for a system or a team or an organization that ask
    for efficiency, let us be aware that, absent countervailing pressures, we are
    probably also asking for the system to become more brittle and fragile, too.\r\n\r\n“Become
    more fragile” is not something I would wish on any team. This is helpful framing."

    This reads like the managerial manifestation of "do you want more boilerplate or more magic [in your codebase]?" Nobody likes having more overhead...but nobody likes the uncertainty of how to handle routine situations, either. Knowing that the tradeoff must be made made feels like the smallest increment of progress.

    to incrementally bring us to the conclusion that “overreliance” is actually convenience,
    the classic affective alibi for all forms of imposed automation: Why would you
    want to bother with the effort of thinking? Where is the edge in that? Why struggle
    internally with how to express yourself when you can instantly produce results?
    Why struggle to find new kinds of consensus with other \r\npeople when all the
    collaboration we need is already built into and guaranteed by the model? What’s
    more robotic than doing what society tells you to do and being part of a group?\r\n\r\nA
    prediction engine will flatten the discourse toward acceptable mediocrity. \r\n\r\n>
    Convenience has also long served as a way to repackage isolation as a treat.\r\n\r\nGeesh.

    advancement. How convenient it is to dine alone in perpetuity."

  title: Writing an engineering strategy
  commentary: "There's a lot of nuggets of truth in this post. Worth the read if you're
    into (engineering) organizational leadership & health.\r\n\r\n> The reason most
    written strategies don’t apply is because they’re actually visions of how things
    could ideally work, rather than accurate descriptions of how things work today.
    This means they don’t help you plot a course through today’s challenges to the
    desired state.\r\n\r\nI've been encountering this in multiple spheres. Changes
    in habits are necessary as an organizations grow. Changes in individual habits
    are slow. Incremental adaptations are the basis of transformation on all horizons.
    Writing things down should be mostly an act of documentation. Maybe 5% of a document
    should be testing out a mutation that you'd like to be true. \r\n\r\n> Once you’ve
    documented them, discussions will happen more frequently, which will create a
    persistent pull towards improvement. It’s better to go slowly than to avoid starting
    altogether.\r\n\r\nThis also matches my experience. Action begins action. Documentation
    unearths differences. The key is making sure everyone understand that understanding
    and clarity is the goal. Most documents are editable. Most decisions are reverisble.
    And most decisions are small bets. One foot in front of the other makes for a
    nice walk in the park."

  commentary: "> The thing about rules and policies is they become very hard to fix
    once they are put in place. Both the people who put them in place and the people
    whose jobs it is to exercise them become highly motivated advocates of the policies.
    Even if the policies originally made sense, they become very hard to change. When
    you try to change something but can’t, you start becoming a tenant and stop being
    an owner."

    trusting relationships with people, both my reports and others—when I’ve been
    able to listen deeply, sit with someone through big feelings, or ask open questions
    and discover the insight that bubbles up—have been the most rewarding parts of
    my career. The times when I’ve missed the chance to do that represent my greatest

    contend that if you add or take away one member you essentially have a whole new
    team because the dynamics and skills within the team are different. So how can
    you convey that idea that the team is significantly different at different stages
    in time?\r\n\r\nImmutability as the backing data structures for teams is a super
    compelling mental model. People intuit this during every transition. \"This is
    going to change the team\"...the language of mutability. It feels primed for loss,
    and slightly hopeful for improvemement. Changing the mental model to \"this is
    a fork of the team\" seems to mitigate the feelings of loss in my mind."

  title: Avoid these traps when nesting Ruby modules
  commentary: It turns out that the “inheritance” of a parent’s constants by the child
    isn’t due to the parent/child relationship. It’s lexical. That means that it’s
    based on the structure of your code, not on the structure of the objects your
    code is building.
